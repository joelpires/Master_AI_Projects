The aim of this work is to plan an experiment so that the data
obtained can be analyzed and conclusions are drawn. The idea for
the project arose within the scope of the 2nd work for the Methodologies course
In Computer Science at the University of Coimbra in the academic year 2017/2018
and in charge of Professor Henrique Madeira.

Given that experimental design takes place in an academic context, it is naturally
simplification of some aspects of the problem is expected, although we face it with
the thoroughness and rigor that it deserves with all the steps that experience of a
software system requires it.

Let us look a little at what is involved in the experimental design of
a task. The purpose of doing this experimental design is to describe or explain the
variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation. In
clearly and concisely, an experiment is intended to predict the outcome in the event to
introduce a change in the preconditions, called independent variables (or
input variables). The alteration of one or more of these variables is hypothesized to
result in a change in one or more dependent variables (or output variables).
It is worth mentioning the existence of control variables that must remain
unchanged in order to prevent external factors from influencing the results. It is then
involved in experimental design not only the selection of dependent variables,
independent and control ones that we think are appropriate, but also the planning of the
delivery of the experience in statistically optimal conditions given the restrictions of the
available resources.

The main concerns in the experimental project that we are going to carry out are the
establishment of validity, reliability, and replication. For this, we will take care of
choose the independent variable carefully, reducing the risk of measurement error and
ensuring that the method documentation is sufficiently detailed. We guarantee
also obtaining adequate levels of statistical power and sensitivity. We will,
therefore, follow all the steps involved in an experiment, namely:

• Define the problem;

• Identify the variables;

• Generate hypotheses;

• Define the experimental setup;

• Develop the tools and procedures necessary to carry out the experience;

• Run the experiment and extract measurements;

• Analyze the data;

• Draw appropriate conclusions.
