This work aims to apply the knowledge acquired in theoretical classes on diffuse systems, namely:

- Neuro-Diffuse Systems - according to specified input produces a certain output value. Especially useful for model processes and systems,

- Diffuse Controllers - Represents a process that is part of the system. Among others, they can be of the Mamdani and Sugeno type. These last two will be implemented and analyzed during this work, each with 9 and 25 logical rules.

The implementation of diffuse controllers on remote issues in Matlab and using the tools of Simulink and Fuzzy Logic Toolbox.

These controllers, which are registered by a diffuse logic, are made up of 3 phases: input, processing, output. There is, then, a mapping of belonging functions and truth values; there is a call to the logic rules applied to the input function; finally, the result of this processing is output.
