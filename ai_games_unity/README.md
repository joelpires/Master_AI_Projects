### Project 1
This is a work developed within the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence of the Computer Engineering course at the University of Coimbra and conducted by Fernando Machado.
In this work, we will develop and explore the capabilities of autonomous reactive agents. For this, Braitenberg Vehicles were chosen. Why? Because they are robots that can exhibit sophisticated behaviors despite their extreme simplicity. These vehicles allow us to simulate different reactions of a living being to various elements of nature (such as light and obstacles) through sensory stimuli processed on different sides/hemispheres.
To develop such a project, the Unity game engine and the C# programming language were used. Unity was useful for us to be able to build vehicles, build test scenarios, and visualize the behaviors manifested by our robots. The C# language gave life to these same robots that manifested the behaviors that we had previously programmed.

### Project 2
This work was developed within the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence of the Computer Engineering course at the University of Coimbra and conducted by Fernando Machado.
In this work, we will develop and explore the capabilities of agents looking for. For this, we will try to solve the game "Sokoban" whose objective is to move all the boxes to certain positions on the map. This is only possible using search algorithms.
To develop such a project, the Unity game engine and the C # programming language were used. Unity was useful for us to be able to build test scenarios and visualize the behaviors manifested by our search agent. The C # language gave life to these same agents that manifested the behaviors of the algorithms that we had previously programmed.

### Project 3
Neste trabalho, vamos desenvolver e explorar como agentes de adaptação adaptativos. Para isso, vamos tentar desenvolver um driver para o jogador de um jogo do estilo “Space Shooter”. O driver tem de fazer com que a nave desvie dos asteróides. Para efeito, usamos algoritmos genéticos.
Para desenvolver esse projeto, use o motor de jogo Unity e a linguagem de programação C #. O Unity foi útil para poder criar cenários de teste e visualizar os comportamentos manifestos pelo nosso agente adaptativo. A linguagem C # deu a vida o mesmo agente que se manifesta nos métodos de algoritmo que nós mesmos já tivemos programado.
