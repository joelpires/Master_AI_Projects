Within the scope of the curricular unit of Artificial Intelligence of the University of Coimbra taught by the teacher Hugo Gonc¸alo Oliveira, a goal oriented conversational agent was developed that was able to interact through text with the user. Called ’Zomato Chatbot’ and having a retrieval based model, it is able to hold trivial conversations with the user, although its main purpose is to provide details about restaurants in the Lisbon and Porto area based on API calls from the application of Zomato.
