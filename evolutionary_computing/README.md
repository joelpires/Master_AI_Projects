Premature convergence is a well-known problem with regard to evolutionary algorithms and, in order to be reduced, it is necessary to guarantee a great diversity of the population. In this work, we will test and compare different algorithms for selecting parents. One is based on tournament selection, another using uniform stochastic sampling, and finally, we use the roulette selection method. The goal will be to understand which one results in both a greater diversity of the population as well as a higher quality of the final result in terms of performance.
