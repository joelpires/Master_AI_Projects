TSR (Traffic Sign Recognition) is a widely used technology for
recognition of road signs on the road.

Our goal with this work will be to develop classifiers for the TSR.
We were provided with a dataset with 43 different traffic signs represented by
photographs taken in a real environment. The training dataset contains 39209 signals while
the test contains 12630. A set of features is also provided
pre-computed.

We will consider three different scenarios:

● Scenario A: it is a binary problem. The aim is only to distinguish the
STOP signal from the rest.

● Scenario B: in this case, we will differentiate between six different classes of
signs, which are: danger signs, obligation signs, prohibition signs
for the speed limit, other prohibition signs, unique signs, and signs
restriction.

● Scenario C: here we will differentiate all 43 signals.
