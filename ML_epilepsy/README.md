The aim of this work is to identify epilepsy crises based on for this in the frequency information provided by Electroencephalograms.

These encephalograms extract data on brain activity being that, from a set of characteristics we can identify moments of epileptic seizures (ectal points), moments that precede and follow crises (pre-ictal and post-ictal respectively) and the remaining moments when no epileptic activity is recorded (inter-ictal points). 

What is the main challenge then of this work? Create an application in Matlab that allows you to analyze these data collected from EEGâ€™s in order to predict or detect crisis situations. For that, neural networks were used available in the Neural Networks Toolbox. In order to evaluate the performance and performance of our application, we calculate the sensitivity and specificity in each test, that is, we calculate the percentage of true ict situations detected (sensitivity) and the percentage of situations false non-icts detected (specificity). We recall that a large specificity implies a good detection of moments when there are no crises and, on the other hand, a high sensitivity refers to a good detection of crisis situations.
